# NFS-Server-Client-Simulation-on-Localhos
This repository documents a project to set up and configure a (NFS) server and client on a single Linux machine. The objective was to simulate a shared network environment using the loopback interface (`127.0.0.1`), demonstrating the core functionalities of NFS, including directory sharing, client mounting, and file transfer testing.
